# Vegetarian website made with React.js

This is my first React project, created for [Start2Impact](https://www.start2impact.it/) React section. <br>
You can visit the site [here](https://veg-recipes-novecento.netlify.app/). <br>
The project was built with the [spoonacular API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api/docs)

## Project requirements

- Search bar that allows you to search for all vegetarian recipes.
- Each recipe searched must show at least title and cover image.
- Clicking on a recipe will take you to a dedicated page, where further information will be shown.
- Simple and easy to use UI and UX.
- Organized and understandable app structure.
- Responsive design.
